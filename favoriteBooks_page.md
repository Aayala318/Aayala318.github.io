## Favorite Books

**Description:** This project was mainly focused on creating and experimenting with the navbar. This was one of my early attempts in creating a navber, it does not have much functionality but does have a logout button within it. The project allows users to add book titles along with the author, they can also favorite and unfavorite books. When a user adds a book, that book will automatically be added to their favorited list and be displayed on their main page. Books that are not favorited by the current user with be in a "Other Books" list.

}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript

  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
